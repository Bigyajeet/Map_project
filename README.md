# MapLibre GL JS Project

This repository contains a web application built using **MapLibre GL JS**, an open-source library for interactive maps on the web. This project serves as a foundation for exploring and manipulating map data, styles, and functionalities using a powerful client-side mapping API.

## Project Overview

The current setup displays a basic interactive map, likely centered on a specific geographic area (from the screenshot, it appears to be Europe, particularly the UK and surrounding regions). It leverages the MapLibre GL JS library to render vector tiles and enable common map interactions like zooming, panning, and potentially displaying popups or markers.

## Features

* **Interactive Map Display:** Utilizes MapLibre GL JS to render a dynamic and responsive map.
* **Base Map:** Displays an OpenStreetMap-based style (or similar, depending on the chosen style URL).
* **Basic Map Controls:** Standard controls for navigation (zoom in/out, pan).

## Technologies Used

* **MapLibre GL JS:** The core JavaScript library for rendering the map.
* **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Standard web technologies for the application's structure, styling, and logic.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
* A local web server (e.g., Python's `http.server`, Node.js `http-server`, VS Code's Live Server extension). Using a local server is crucial for MapLibre GL JS to load assets correctly and avoid CORS issues.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Bigyajeet/Map_project.git](https://github.com/Bigyajeet/Map_project.git)
    cd Map_project
    ```

2.  **Open with VS Code (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    code .
    ```

3.  **Run a Local Web Server:**
    The simplest way to run a local server is often using the "Live Server" extension in VS Code.
    * Install the "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey from the VS Code Extensions Marketplace.
    * In VS Code, open the `index.html` file.
    * Right-click anywhere in the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server" (or click the "Go Live" button in the bottom right of the VS Code status bar).

    Alternatively, you can use Python's built-in server:
    ```bash
    # From the project root directory (Map_project)
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```
    Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.

## Future Enhancements & Ideas for Manipulation

This project is a perfect starting point for adding more advanced map functionalities. Here are some ideas:

* **Adding Markers/Pins:** Displaying specific points of interest on the map.
* **Drawing Tools:** Implementing tools for users to draw points, lines, or polygons on the map.
* **GeoJSON Integration:** Loading and visualizing geospatial data from GeoJSON files.
* **Custom Map Styles:** Applying different base map styles or creating your own custom styles.
* **Popups and Interactivity:** Displaying information in popups when features are clicked.
* **Search Functionality:** Integrating geocoding services to search for locations on the map.
* **Routing/Navigation:** Using routing APIs to display directions between points.
* **Heatmaps:** Visualizing density of data points.
* **Time-Series Data:** Displaying changes in map data over time.
* **Layer Toggling:** Allowing users to turn different map layers on and off.
* **User Location:** Displaying the user's current geographic location.
